Call for papers
=================

Dear Reserachers and Scholars, 

Geoinformatics Research Days is the annual gathering for geoinformatics experts in Finland, 
which has been arranged by the member universities of the 
**Finnish University Network for Geoinformatics (Fiuginet)** for over 10 years.

Traditionally, the Research Days have been a relatively small-scale event with mostly invited programme. 
However, in 2023 *Fiuginet* made the decision to develop the event into a scientific conference, and therefore 
we are proud to announce the **Call for papers** for *Geoinformatics Research Days 2024*. 
The event will take place on May 2024 and will be organized by *Aalto University* together with the *Fiuginet* network, 
hosted in *Espoo, Finland.*

We invite researchers, practitioners, and experts from academia, industry, and government sectors both in 
Finland and abroad to submit their research contributions for presentation during the *Geoinformatics Research Days 2024*. 
The conference will cover a broad spectrum of topics related to Geoinformatics, including but not limited to:

1. Geospatial Data Acquisition and Processing
2. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing
3. Spatial Data Analysis and Visualization
4. Geospatial Algorithms and Modeling
5. Geospatial Web and Mobile Applications
6. User Cognition in Geospatial Applications
7. Location-Based Services and Geographic Information Retrieval
8. Big Data Analytics for Geospatial Applications
9. Spatial Data Infrastructures and Interoperability
10. Geoinformatics for Smart Cities and Urban Planning
11. Environmental Monitoring and Geospatial Solutions
12. Disaster Management and Emergency Response
13. Geoinformatics for Sustainable Development
14. Geospatial AI and Machine Learning Applications
15. Open Geospatial Science and Open Source Software

Your participation in the *Geoinformatics Research Days 2024* will make a significant contributions, foster collaboration,
and shape the future of Geoinformatics. Together, let's advance the understanding and application of geospatial technologies 
for a more sustainable and interconnected world.
